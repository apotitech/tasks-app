## Description

- A platform to manage your tasks with details like: title, description, date, mark as completed, and flag as important.
- Tasks are organized in routes: today's tasks, important tasks, incomplete, completed, all tasks, and tasks by directory (folder). Both directories and tasks can be edited or deleted. Additionally, there's a primary directory called "Main" which cannot be edited or deleted.
- The task list can be sorted by: nearest due, furthest due, completed, or incomplete.
- You can search for specific tasks using the search bar. 🔍
- Today's tasks are displayed in the user's section and in notifications.
- Task data, directories, and dark mode settings are stored in the localStorage. 💾
